1079196.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;Personally, I agree with the statement saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. However, I do not think that this statement is completely correct. I have to admit that there are several companies advertising their products in an honest way, stating only facts about the product without any misleading slogans or jingles.On the other hand, the majority of today\s industries is clever enough to trick their customers into buying their products. They do so by either creating highly convincing advertisemetns with slogans or jingles people tend to associate with the product, or they claim characteristics and facts about the products that are simply untrue. The most effective advertising strategy next to an easy to remember jingle you cannot get out of your head is advertising with the support of celebrities presenting the product. Even though I do not like the idea of being lied to by a company, I can certainly understand this marketing mentality that is so widely spread today. In a world of globalization, open borders and free markets, every market of every country is flooded with an increadibly high number of foreign products. Not only do foreign products mostly seem more attractive to customers, they are often cheap copies of orginals invented and produced in the home country. Monoplies hardly ever exist anymore and competing not only with other companies in the country but especially with foreign companies certainly is rough. However, I think companies should only try to manipulate customers to a certain extent. There should be a clear difference between lying completely and persuading and influecing a little. Being a customer myself, of course, I rely on the government to control marketing strategies on the one hand but I definitely rely on own experiences I make on the other hand. If I know about a product that it does not fulfill all the expectations the company made me believe in, I will try my best to convince others not to buy it and I hope others will do so as well. And even if companies tend at times to overestimate a little and seem to be too euphemistic about their products, we still live in a world where people have gotten used to this kind of advertising behavior by now. I think, there is only a small percentage of society left that truly believes all the statements made in advertisement. I therefore have the hope that companies of the future will rely on attractive advertisements instead of on false statements.;1.7306844659166793;5.0

1109085.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;"People often argue about what is more important for students to learn: ideas and concepts; or facts. Based on my four years of experience as a teacher, I strongly believe that it is far more important for students to learn ideas and concepts. Facts change very quickly, whereas ideas and concepts remain useful for a lifetime.One of the most important objectives of education is to prepare the students for their future careers. I believe that students who understand the ideas and concepts well have a much better chance to succeed in the future than those who simply learn facts. This is especially evident in disciplines like science and engineering, where there is very little that one can do by simply memorizing facts. A student who only learns the basic equations about electricity can not solve problems that involve combining various concepts or ideas. It is far more important for the student to understand the fundamental concepts and ideas, and develop an ability to make use of these concepts to develop his or her own solutions to practical problems. Similary, in history, it is a lot more important to understand the context of a war, rather than learn the simple fact that the war took place in a certain year. For example, it would be a lot more useful to understand why and how Hitler came to power in Germany, rather than the dates of particular events. Another factor that illustrates the relative importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts is also evident from the rate at which facts are changing. The rapid developments in science and technology change the so-called facts at such a high speed that it does not make sense for a student to spend too much time on learning facts. As a teacher, I often notice that many text-books that I have begun to use for my classes only a few years ago have already become out of date! Ideas and concepts, on the other hand continue to be valid over much longer periods of time. Moreover, in many cases, it is even possible for the students to apply a concept they learned in one area to some other areas. Facts, on the other hand, can not be easily transferred from one area to another.";1.624755936107523;4.0

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;Universities have considerably different educational systems. Some focus on providing students with theorical concepts and ideas, while other opted for practical learning methods. Both of these methods have advantages and I personally think that if a perfect educational system could exist then it should combine them.Theorical concepts are necessary for students. Indeed, they should help them to understand, model and simulate phenomena. No doubt they may complicated and perhaps boring to study, but students should pay attention to them and check wether they get them correctly or not.Nevertheless, practical activities are also required in teaching activities. In fact, they can help students to understand theorical concepts. Students will more likely understand a phenomena by a short experiment rather than by a long and perhaps boring lecture. They would understand it even better indeed.Moreover students are generally more motivated to learn this way.In addition students understand better when they do thing by themselves through practical projects and so on. In other words, they understand better what they discovered themselves than what they had been taught by others.In my school, I had both theorical teachings and practical teaching, and from my experiece I can say that combining these two methods in the right way is very fruitful for the students.For example, I have had in two industrial internship. From these experiences I learnt a lot which I certainly could not have learnt otherwise. I learnt about how thing work in a company, how workers behave to each other and ;1.6726729153199744;5.0

I am agree with the statement, young people do not eve have enough time to interact with others.People in the past liked to communicate with people, with their neighborhood, with family members,with students at school. Now it seems to me that they give more response to computers they have around, to i-pods they have in their pocktes and to any technology witch is facninating them. They dont have anough time for other things beacuse they just see the fact of 0s and 1s the same as the digital life, only true and false. So, there will be no other things around bothering them. Old man trying to cross the road, child running trough the car on the road, rubish trown on the road will not bother them at all because they have their own life, own world as tehy have nothing to share with others.The real fact is that, no education supporting the idea that young people should pay more response to their community is made. Schools, goverment or families are also responsible. There might be a will of helping their communities on young people but i dont really see the act suppporting them.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;" I concede that in some respects, the young should contribute to their communities more in which they live in. However, beyond this concession, because of the new technology, the young are beginning to help their communities in some nations.Therefore, on balance, I do not agree with the statement. Admittedly, at a first glance, they do not give much time to help their community. This is especially true when it comes to developed countries. Compared with the decades ago, young people are required to study hard because they have to master more and more diverse skills including informaiton technology. In my observation, due to the time required to learn these skills, they do not have much enough time to contribute to their community. Nevetheless, the statement overlooks some positive changes that the young people have experienced. Thanks to the advent of the information technology, more and more young people help their communities using the technology. For example, a number of young people used the technology to support humanitalian projects in many communities. The young in Japan supported the people who lost their houses because of a massive eathquake by calling for the financial support on the Internet. Thus, they can and do use the technology to solve local problems. It would be tempting to argue that the young are not interested in their community considering their apathy in politics in some nations. However, the statement overstates the situation of such nations. When it comes to nations where political situations are not stable, the young are forced to participate in their communities. For instance, we do not have to look no further than Taiwan. Because of their severe condition in which the pressure from Beijing is massive, the young are serious about their future and their nation. Thus, the statement unfairly ignores such young people. In sum, because of their difficulties, many young people do not have much time to helping their communities; however, the advent of the informaiton technology made it possible for them to participate in the community in new ways. They are getting involved with their communities through these means.";1.6359304176215943;4.0

I agree with the statement which says that successful people try to do new things even take risks rathre trying known things. I agree becuse of severals resons. The frist reson is that successful people shoud try to do new things otherwase they will not bring new things. For example, the Neoten is well- known and pioneeir in this feild. He looked to the apple which fall down from the tree as other but He looked to this case different from other and asked himself why did it fall. As a result, he interdouced a new law of movement.

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;Nowadays a lot of people like to take riks and test their own limit. Everybode tries to hone their abillities. Some argue that this way of life is just limited to successful people, because they achieved nearly everything else . On the one hand, the successful people explore new things and have less concern about risks. But on the other hand, I think, that these features are not just traits of successful people, rather a typical human behavior like eating.The need for certain risks, new expieriences and to be good at something is part of everyones way of life.First, risks is often connected to the hormon adrenaline. If a person is in a dangerous situation his or her adrenaline level increases. This is often assiciated with a drug or the feeling to be alive. Successful people may have a greater need, because of their prior accomplishments, but this feeling and the hormon is common to every human being.Second, the desire to try out new things and gain new expieriences is common to everyone. For examples, young children explore their surroundings and they find mostly great joy in it. This behaviour has obviously nothing to do with success.Third, we live in a highly specialized world and nobody is able to be good at everything. Successful people, to my mind, have specialized in one trait to be successful. To learn another skill may lessen their ability to be good at their prime skill or at work. I study electrical engineering and i have to specialize to recieve an adequate education. Without the proper education I will not be able to find a job and because of this I will not be successful.In conclusion, you can say that there may be a stronger appeal for successful people to experiment with new things, but the main ideas are merely human. The successful will not experiment extensively, because they will use the etch that made them successful.;1.6069271313911409;4.0

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;low;In the last fifty years the number of cars in use is increased all over the world, expecially in Europe and in the north of America. In theese countries almost everybody (between eighteen and sixty years old) have his own car and the problems concerned with this situation are becoming very high.The increasing of traffic and pollution are two of the more negative results of the excessive use of cars and nowdays there are a lot of purposed to resolve theese problems.Many majors, for example, suggest to close the a part of their cities to the cars and this will be good also in order to preserve the beauty of the city centres (especially if there are historical and artistical monuments, like in italian cities). But this will create the problem of moving from a place to another (people have to go to work or to school) so it will be necessary to improove the public transports.In my own experience, Ive seen that, depite of all theese purposed, anything has been done.

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;In my opinion the usage of cars will stay at a steady level, rather increase. Changes in propellants, road conditions, and a growing population can disagree in single points of views, but mostly suggest an increase in the number of cars.Scientists, governments, and car manufacturers are in the process of developing and improving engines using alternative propellants. These propellants include gas, hydrogen, or electricity, but are not limited to those. This development can cause a smaller dependency on oil. If this is true twenty years from now, people might have switched to those alternative propellants and do not see the necessity to get rid of a car in general.Arguments saying that the number of cars will decrease include facts like congested roads because of a growing population or a decreasing quality of road conditions. In addition some people claim and favor the usage of public transportation. I assume the behavior of people will not be changed in a recognizable amount. In a large city as I am living in both previously mentioned facts are true. Cars are though used in an increasing number. For many people the car still has more advantages than public transportation. As prices for public transportation also increase attitudes about this issue are unlikely to change twenty years from now.As mentioned before, population is increasing. Personally I am familiar with the Orlando, FL area. Throughout the past five years an incredible extension of the metropolitan area could be observed. I suppose that an increasing population causes areas to grow - making distances longer. This again can probably not be compensated by public transportation. People will continue to use cars. As far as I have experienced people mostly favor individual transportation in their cars rather than in crouded buses and trains. I doubt a chance in the future.Responses of urban and rural areas might also differ in response to this issue and must not be neglected. Generally I conclude a tendency to an increasing number of cars based on personal experience.;1.6336025582828653;4.0

There are so many examples that prove this statement to be true.I am taking a psychology class at my school and we actually had an assignment about this. We had to bring an advertisement to class out of a magazine or newspaper that represents a product. Advertisements are always exaggerated to be better than they actually are. People advertise their products in order to sell it. It is a business and no business will be successful without positive feedback. Of course, if the product seems good, people are going to want to buy it. The advertisement that I brought into class was a cigarette ad. I found it on the back of a magazine lying around at school. The cigarette brand was ""Kool."" The ad showed a young man laughing and seeming happy. He was holding a trumpet trumpet in one hand while holding a cigarette in the other. This advertisement made cigarettes seem much better than they really are. Everyone knows that cigarettes are bad for your health and are in general just disgusting, but ads like these make people think twice.Another example of making products look better than they truely are, are food products. Many food companies that produce the same food as another company, will compete with that company. Both food companies will have to make their foods look better and sound better than that of the other companys. These advertisements will start popping up everywhere like on TV. Advertisements like these are found everywhere you go. When you are at home, you will se advertisements on TV or receive it in the mail. When you are walking through the city, you will see posters hanging on the sides of the street or on the side of a bus. People cannot get away from it, which is good for the businesses, but bad for the people.

The first is that I experienced how advertisements can lie in my own life. I saw a new hair shampoo at the TV, which should make my hair more shiny and easier to form. Because of this advertisment I went to the shop and bought the shampoo. Maybe my hair was shinier after using the shampoo, but it was not easy to model it at all. In reality it was even more difficult. This is one of the examples which made me casting doubt on advertisements. Now I always question what is shown.Another reason is that I compare what I see in the advertisements with the things I can buy at the shops. Through this it is obvious that the advertisments are lies. Everything looks so colorful at the TV but in reality it is not colorful at all. It is just like every other product you can buy in the shop, which is not advertised.Finally, one can sometimes see how advertisements are produced. That completely convinces one that advertisments make products seeming better than they are. Take for example some sort of food. When people want to advertise such products they have special strategies for it. The most interesting is that most times the food is not real. Advertisers just put it together with artificial materials. So it looks better and you just want to buy it. You will never find products in advertisments in their original way. That is a big lie to the customers, is it not?To sum up, I think that advertisements make products better than they really are because of my own experience, compares between advertised products and the actual products in the shops and because of the way advertisements are produced.;1.6713702963702968;5.0
1453563.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;In a students life, good learning is by studying from part to whole. This means that a student can do better if his basic knowledge of understanding is good. Learning facts is a part of study but one needs to deep knowledge to grasp facts and this comes by understanding ideas and concepts.For example, a Biology student who is doing a research in the field of microrganisms can go ahead with his research only if he has the basic idea of microorganisms and their behaivour. By only learning facts, he cannot reach a final decision. To have his findings more a solid basis, he needs to have a strong foothold in microorganic study.Similar factors work with students who have just joined school or the ones who are in the process of a learning new subject. For instance, a mathematics student can do his high level arithmetic and algebra only if his lower level maths skills are developed. Furthermore, these skills become an inherent quality when he knows how to derive at a formula. Although learning a formula will make him work out easy problems but he will get stuck in the major issues.In this sequence we can also come to a solution that understanding things is the key to success than merely knowing facts. A fact may help you out in the short run. It will not pave your path to reach your goal. A clear understanding develops interest in students to pursue their future in an innovative field of any branch instead of working on the set patterns by their ancestors. These criteria will also lead the world towards new technologies and sciences that are still undiscovered. Considering all the above facts I completely disagree to the fact that it is important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to lern facts.;1.6899198588004702;5.0

1599482.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;To answer the question, if most advertisements make products much better than they really are I want to procide in a certain way.Since the question states that not all advertisements, but most of them are making a product look much better than it really is, I am just going to give some examples in order to empiricly prove that the given statement is correct.In that order my first example is the Mc Donalds french fries.When you see their commercial on TV, where it is these tasty french fries just shouting out of that shimmering red box, they always look just fabulous. They are thick and have that perfect yellow-brownish color. And almost more important they lie in that box perfectly organized. Not a single one is misplaced.Comparing that wounderful illusion of Mc Donalds french fries with the reallity one has to come to the conclusion that there is a gigantic diffrence between them. That example hereby strongly supports the given statement.To give another example one just has to look at one of these energy drink advertisements. The advertisements tell you that by consuming that nice colored, always cooled looking drink all of your lost power or energy will be restored immediatly. Most of these advertisements also make one feel that one becomes more attracitve by drinking that baverrage.As in the first example the advertisement gives one an image of the product which does not correspond to the reallity.Altough I have to admit that I did not try every existing energy-drink I believe I can tell by the dozen I have tried that they are neighter as good looking, nor as good energy restoring as the advertisement wants to make one believe.As these to examples perfectly show advertisements usually make a product seem much better than it really is, which is nothing to wonder about if one looks at the purpose of an advertisement.Since advertisements are made to increase the number of sold units of a product, of course they try to make everyone believe that they are buying a perfect product. ;1.4805918915822252;4.0

162639.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;In my personal opinion, it is true that most of the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are mainly two reasons that accounts for this phenomena. One is that young people today concern more about their self-interests than the interests of the community. The onther reason is that yongsters today are more aloof with people around them. Some adults blame the education, and some blame the society for the characteristics that young people bear nowadays. Adults believe these adolescents to be selfish and care only what they are interested in, and what will beneifit them most because our education do not emphasis on caring people and communities. Youngsters never show interest in helping their communities because they dont think they have anything to do with their communites. They dont believe that the community will do them any good or will benefit on them. Many have strong concept that if they spend time and get involve in helping the communities, troubles will come. The more one involves, the more things waits you to help. And finally, your time is deprived and that your own work wont get done. On the other hand, theres a weird notion which sometimes spread through television programs that makes young people feel more aloof with people around them. The reason is that by showing much compassion and enthusiasm in helping the commuty may sometimes result in an unecessary troubles. There are many news broadcasts reporting that people get kidnapped or robbed when they are helping others to find way home, or helping those who pretend to be injured. These things happens so often that people are scared and unwilling to help others. Thus finally, people become more aloof with each other inorder to protect oneself from being harmed. All in all, selfishness and coldness of the young people taday make them unwilling to devote themselves to public interests, like helping their communities. The fact is that community interests does not concern them, and they are afraid of being hurt. They dont want to devote on things that wont pay them back. Therefore, I agree that young people are not spending time to helping their communities due to above reasons. ;1.5760702083863847;4.0

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;Young people enjoy life more than older people do. I am against this statement and have strong points to support myself. We read the newspapers and magazines and see that its only the young people dominating the front pages and party scenes. This creates a general misconception in peoples minds that the youthful age is the age when life is meant to enjoy rather than when were forty or fifty plus. We might think that this is true, but if we put ourselves in , say, our fathers shoes. We conclude that life is all about going to work in the morning and coming back home tired. This isnt fun right? Well, now that a misconception. Older people attain enjoyment in places where we dont see anything but a boring event. Let me compare myself and my dad. I enjoy myself by going out to the movies with my friends etc., which I dont usually see my dad doing. Does that mean that my dad doesnt enjoy life? Wrong. My dad loves his work and takes pleasure in going to work everyday, and even on Sundays. He cant stand sitting home just lying in front of the television having pizzas and sundaes. That was supposed to be fun for me but for my dad, no! My dad really enjoys his early morning yoga sessions and tennis games, and really looks forward to them. To me these are nothing but time wasted which could be spent in sleeping, going out to parties etc. Whenever I take a close look at my dad I notice that he is really happy and enjoying life to the fullest while Im not. Concluding, it all depends on the way we analyze the given statement. We may think were the ones getting most out of our lives but no, older people also have a life and look forward to it more than we do.;1.6237557889364038;4.0

1723586.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;The issue of traveling with a tour guide is a controversial one. Some people find it to be beneficial, and more informative while others think that traveling on their own is more challenging.I , however believe that traveling with a group guide is better. The reasons for my belief are the following:First, traveling with a tour guide is more informative, since the guide has all the information about the place, and should be able to answer any question. He has also visited the place many times, and knows all the interesting places to be seen. I think that a person traveling with a tour guide will gain much more inforamtion and knowledge about a countrys culture, than if he was to travel by himself. I have travelled with a tour guide once to Turkey, and although it was a tiring trip because the schedule was full, I got to know most of the turkish culture. One of the things I wont forget, is when we visited a play about the old traditional turkish wedding. It was a very interesting thing to see.Second, the tour guide usually has a schedule for his group. In this schedule the group gets to see the most important, famous, and interesting places in the country being visited, probably a person visiting the country on his own would not have been aware of, or could not have planned such a schedule. I find the time schedule to be my ultimate reason to choose a tour guide. Another reason, is the financial reason, usually tour guides have special deals with hotels or resturants since they bring them customers.Third, I believe that traveling with a tour guide who knows the country, and traveling with a group of people is much safer than traveling alone. When visiting a new place, a person does not know the safe places, or what time is a good time to walk in a certain neighborhood. These details, which are of great importance, are taken care of by the tour guide.For all of the reasons, I mentioned above I believe that it is a much safer, and more interesting experience to travel with a tour guide, if of course traveling to a country for the first time.;1.4403200174809745;3.0
1728162.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;"Swamped with commercials and advertisments in our daily lives, one might wonder whether a products quality really correspond to the one being put forward by the ad or promotion. Although legally, companies can be held responsible for false advertisment, I believe that most of the sales and marketing campaigns for products do not reflect the real character of the product in question.First of all, the praised outcomes of for instance cleaning products, can be questioned, as they deem to be very little effective for the actual purpose. Spot removal products are particularly known for this. Although TV commercials highly recommend their use, real-life results tend to be rather frustrating. An ink spot or tomato sauce stain on your favorite yellow summer dress resists despite your desperate attempts of removing it with the highly suggested product. Unfortunately, one cannot blame the company, as the small print on the product usually allows for many loopholes regarding the interpretation of a products effectiveness.Furthermore, ad-campaigns, especially on TV or in the movie theatres, incite the viewers to step into a dreamland and do not reflect reality. By presenting a product, such as a Sports Utility Vehicule (SUV), as indestructable, indefeatable and magnificant, it may trigger hidden desires in potential customers. Yet, it is not important whether the product will be able to fulfill all the advertised qualities. In other words, the consumer, who will end up purchasing the item, will most likely not need all the functions (e.g. four-wheeling) if the SUV is being used in an urban setting only. Nonetheless, it is important for the sake of the customer to maintain that dream alive.Another argument, which supports my hypothesis is related to weight-watching products. It might be true that a person is able to lose a great amount of weight within the promoted time frame; however, this is rather a transient result. In fact, most of the time, customers who tried such products before, have found themselves with twice the weight they had before. Thus, the ad was only meant to effect short-term outcomes, rather than long-term related results.In sum, the problem which advertisements are facing is a ""catch 22"". While they need to promote and even enhance the qualities and capacities of a product in order to incite consumers to buy it, they tend to exaggerate and paint an inaccurate picture of its real skills, which can lead to frustrating consumer experiences.

This Competition are the main reason who move a corporation to tells lies about his own product.

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;I agree with the statement that the successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. I think trying new things would make people successful. This is because you can get to know more about different things and expand your views from many perspectives. Seeking more into one subject is a great thing, but trying to do new things would be more beneficial in the future. By doing new things throughout your life can make them experienced. Its a wonderful thing to be an experienced person. By being an experienced person, people can solve more problems than those of the people who only know one thing and has interest in one thing. I think expanding your views and being experienced would lead you to gain reliance from people. Many people respect those of the people who have their own point of views and experiences. So by being the one who is respected, they would be surrounded by people who are respectful and reliable. Taking risks rather than not will make that persons heart strong. I think to be an successful person, you would need to have some kind of risk. Larger the risk, the stronger youll be. It is because you cannot get stronger if you do not have courage to take the risk. Its is not the risk that is important. It is the courage that is important when you take the risk. It is hard to be courageous at first, however, after you have taken that risk, you would be very satisfied with what you have done. There are many ways for a person to be successful and these examples are only few out of those many ways. I always think that experienced and courageous people can be successful with their life in a lot of different ways.;1.5918490307520496;4.0
1834502.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;" There is a famous saying which reads: ""Give a hungry man a fish and he will be full for the day, give him a fishing rod and he will be full for the rest of his days."" I strongly agree with what the proverb says and furthermore I believe the same logic applies in this case, as well. The understanding of the ideas and concepts is just like the rod, whereas the facts are the fish that last only a day. I believe that an ideal education should equip students with the necessary techniques and concepts to tackle any problem as opposed to the specific solutions for the problems only covered in classes. This enables students to deal with a much wider array of problems as they learn a general recipe of problem solving compared to a case specific approach. One great example from contemporary education would be history classes. If facts were more important, then all a student would need to learn would be the years of certain events. However, I believe, and the statement asserts, that the motivations and consequences in a specific historic event should be studied more than the facts and dates. Rather than memorizing the year of a battle, an ideal history course should concentrate on the succession of the events that lead to the war. This, in turn, would enable students to reflect upon themselves and overcome similar challenges in their lives. Afterall life is a series of clashing interests, and it has been that way throughout history. Another proverb goes: ""History repeats itself"". It is true only if we value the facts more than the ideas behind the events. Similarly, in maths, a student should be learning how to solve all problems of a certain type, as opposed to one specific setting. Once a student learns the fundemental approach to solving, then s/he may resolve any question of the similar type. Having studied maths, I believe I have a greater first hand experience with the latter example. The comprehension of concepts rather than pure learning of the facts is the mathematical philosophy. In any type of problem that maths deals with, the main aim is to deduce an overall solution for all problems of the same kind. Lastly, to conclude I would like to reestablish the importance of understanding ideas and concepts. Actually in schooling this indeed is the nuance. Learning at schools is more about the concepts than about the facts. When this occurs, the students realize the statement itself, and going back to my initial analogy, you make their life an ocean full of fish. They try to learn something and anything, anywhere and anytime, because they have their rod.";1.5022404350035927;4.0

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;Since the ancient times, man has investigated ways to improve the ways to explore the world and cover great distances with minimum effort. From the invention of the wheel, to the establishment of the trade routes via ships, transportation has come a long way and gained even more importance. In todays world, being able to travel freely is no longer a privilage, but a basic right for all human beings. And, we simply would not be able to fully appreciate this right, if we did not have cars.Cars give us the ability to travel individually and freely, assuming that we can afford to buy one and operate it. They are essential for people who work, have families and have busy schedules. One must also remember that for some people, their cars are essential in their struggle to make a living. For instance people like taxi drivers and transporters rely on their cars. As a result I believe that no matter how well the public transportation gets, in the next twenty years or so, there will still be a demand for individually owned and operated cars. I belive that the need for cars will even be more significant with the expected increase in human population expected within the next two decades.In todays modern world, twenty years is a long enough time for significant technological achievements to take place. As a result, I also believe that these achievements will have a remarkable impact for cars as well. I think cars will be a lot more different from what we have today. They are going to be more efficient, more cost effective, less polluting and safer to operate. Thus, more and more people would buy cars, or whatever replaces them, and as a result we will have more cars in the future.People like cars for the things they offer us. Things like freedom, independence and ability to make a living It is very important for all of us to have these things in our lives and cars can make this a reality. By improving the means we produce cars in the next twenty years, it is possible satisfy the ever growing human population with the finish form of cars technology has to offer. As a result I belive that the need for cars will be increasing in the decades to follow as well as their numbers in our lives.;1.7601001508362861;5.0
1876159.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;"I strongly agree with the fact that successful people are avid risktakers. But first lets specify what success means?? Success not only means to be happy in terms of wealth, fame and appreciation, it also has a lot of bearing to self-satisfaction and the feeling of being at peace with oneself. Only if successful people cared about fame and money then I surely think that percentage of successful people living would have been far higher than it exists. The reason being there are defined and speculative ways for ganing wealth and fame or making pots of money. But for being successful in truest sense you have to be a risk taker. Not essentially in terms of an explorer amid the ghostly white setup of Artic in his mission to reach the pole, but also in terms of an individual whose philosophy involves inviting new ideas, redefining the conventions and more importantly unlearing the redundant practices. The people we today see enjoying corporate success, political success or even as movie stars have one thing in common. They dared to look beyond what was obvious. Then they took the next step or ""risk"" of questioning it and redefining it with a new startegy. Thus not only Warren Buffet, Fidel Castro and Robin Williams did that they changed the way people look at the usual and maybe mundane workings of earning profits, driving a nation and being an accomplished actor. This kind of reversal and effective transition of the geography of tasks, work and assignments in to challenges and goals is what defines successful people from rest of the lot. I firmly believe that certain degree of non-conformity and questioning of dogmatic beliefs is also an ingredient to take your success to the next level. People would ridicule you, laugh at you or even hurl abuses at you but remember companies like Apple Inc. werent born out of cosy cushions of money and self apprasing practices. It grew rapidly due to creativity and innovative ideas which also involve considerable risk and questioning but payback is healthy and self satisfactory.To summarize the essay the society should be made of free thinkers and risk takers alongwith people who understand there vision, garner it and substantiate it into a reality.

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;" In my opinion , I would agree with the statement that says ,""It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts."" But students have to learn both concepts and facts. Then they have to compare between them and decide . and sometimes facts change with the daily increase in science feilds like physics . for example people used to think that earth is like the sphere then it was found that it is not exactly a sphere but has an oval shape. And facts too that dinasours were just myth till they found the bones of real dinasours. So when a student understand cocepts and ideas , he can think and used his brain and maybe discover something that can change facts . But this still doesnt mean that they shouldnt learn facts . They have to learn facts but concepts and ideas are more important . Lets say for example the laws of motion they are concepts but they were used in may discoveries after that . why the first fact was that when you throw an apple in the air it falls back . Therefore facts are important but concepts and ideas are needed for students and well after that scientists to discover things . On the other sides facts are very important too . For example the fact that if you jumped out of the window of the 7th floor , you will die. If someone doesnt know this fact in the end he is going to die just because he wants to know what will happen if he jumped but thats a far example because in our days this would never happen . other thing is the fact that human cant just disappear. But by studying concepts and ideas and doing tests. You find that you can trick someone and you cannot be seen if you walk slowly and walk in the dark parts without making noise. Illusion too is that you use concepts that human mind cant explain so you trick people by doing that . So in the end both concepts and facts are important .

1949465.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;I agree that twenty from now there will be fewer cars in use. The problems associated with traveling by car will far outweigh the advantages offered by it. This, I believe, will definitely make more people abandon cars and use other means of transport.If we continue to use fuel at the same rate as we do today, we will definitely run out of fuel in twenty years. Since cars are entirely dependent on the non-renewable resources, there will be no fuel left for cars after twenty years. The littel amount of fuel that would be left would become so expensive that it would be beyond the reach of many. This would automatically mean a decrease in number of cars. Awareness about fuel shortage and resource conservation is rapidly increasing which I am sure would propel more people to opt for public transport systems instead of private vehicles. Car-pooling will also be considered as an option by many.The pollution levels are at an all time high due to an enormous increase in the number of vehicles plying on the road. Such high pollution levels are already making goverments sit up and take appropriate measures to reduce the pollution. As part of reducing the pollution levels, the number of vehicles that will be allowed to ply on the road may also be restricted. The traffic snarls that one faces these days are so irritating that people will prefer to either use public means of transport or work from home. The advent of internet and other technologies has meant that now one can sit at home and perform all the business transactions. This mode of operation will be preferred over the conventional mode of operating through an office. Transport through underground railways is cheaper, faster and more convinient. These features of rail transport will definitely allure more people towards rail transport.Any technology has various phases to it. The automobile industry has seen its peak period now and slowly peple will realize the banes of owning cars. Therss the problem of maintenance which takes up lot of time and effort. Instead of taking the pains to get the car serviced and maintained, one would travel by other means of transport. The problem of parking will become so acute that people will prefer not to use their own car except for dire emergencies.Todays generation is more health concious and wants to stay in shape. What better way to stay in shape than to walk? Walking as an excersise will gain popularity and will be considered by many.Considering all the issues mentioned above, I truly believe that there will be fewer cars in twenty years from now. ;1.6977792768233944;5.0

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;"I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than simply learning facts. However, sometime learning facts is necessary.In the following paragraph i will state my reasons why i do agree with the statement.First of all I think in todays society and business it is important to communicate. Discussing and talking about problems and ideas in a classroom gives you the ability to talk to people more easily even if you are not the same opinion. You learn to understand their idea and why they might think this specific way.Another important thing is another benefit for your future job. Today you might be sitting in a classroom with a teacher helping you with every question you ask him or her but sooner or later you probably will be sitting in a business meeting, in a office or even be teaching a class full of students yourself. If you have learned to understand the ideas and concepts of things you also learned to solve problems. If you didnt understand it at first, you looked for answers and ways that you might be able to understand it.The third thing is that it is probably easier to learn for a test when you get the main idea or the whole concept. When you prepare for a test and just learn facts the whole time but dont know how they fit together or what their connection is, it is pointless. You might know it untill the next day but you will forget it in about a month. However, if you learned the whole concept and understood it, you are familiar with it and it is easier for you to recall things. I would like to support my statement with an example: In Math it is very easy to solve problems after you have understood the main idea and the concept of the solution. Some tasks might be harder but you always know at least the way to solve them. If someone would just learn the formulars but doesnt know how to use them or how to combine them he wont do good on any test.Even so I support the statement I have to say that there are some majors where learning facts is partly necessary. For example if you learn a new language you first just study the vocabulary.When you do history you have to learn dates and ""timetables"". In the end, however, it always matters that someone understands the whole idea.";1.5101930217345236;4.0

You could do all the tiresome activities, you could run at the sea with your lover, you could dance with your lover till midnight and you would have the passion to make love with her/him. I accept that there are some elder people who could run faster than some younger people or who could do harder activities, But they are exception and they are in minority. Younger people also think that there is a long and happy life in future. They could probably die before they reach their 60s. But they do not accept it in their minds.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;"I disagree with the above statement for, simply put, it means ""Jack of all trades and master of none"". I certainly have no idea who came up with this particular phrase but I do percieve it to be very true and apt. A ""broad knowledge"" to my understanding may be defined as enough facts to project a scholarly image in refined society. In other words, claiming to have a read a book by reading its back cover. Limited knowledge of multiple topics is of no real use unless a persons vocation requires him to possess such knowledge. Specialization on the other hand is what leads to pure genius. Certainly some men are born a true genius. But others can get there through hard and consistent work in their particular field meaning specialization. To support my idea I put forward four exemplaries, Indian nuclear scientists - Dr. Homi Bhaba, Vikram Sarabhai, Raja Ramanna, Dr. Abdul Kalam. These men shaped Indian nuclear history. They absorbed nuclear science into their very blood and brought about a revolution in the nuclear field. India owes its present day nuclear status to these men who laid the foundation stone for the edifice of Indian Nucleardom. What would be our status today if these men settled for a broad outlook on general knowledge ?But this is not to indicate that specialization makes every person reach the heights that these four have achieved. But certainly an in-depth knowledge of any subject leaves the individual with a personal sense of satisfaction for actually having achieved a milestone and also brings him a respectful position in society where his achievement is appreciated by both his friends and others. If we, for example take a heart specialist or a engineer constructing houses, they cannot hope to execute their respective tasks without specialization in their fields. They touch the live of all the people they serve and in addition to their remuneration, they also earn the lasting gratitude of the people for a service well-rendered.";1.662604074733013;5.0

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;"In my opinion today it is more important to specialize in one specific subject. Each field of science has developed very fast and branched out widely during the last 100 years. Today it is not even possible to have knowledge about each part of a scientific area. For example the area of physics can be devided into hundreds of different parts. There is the research of atomic behaviour in contrast to the research of forces that influence movements in our universe. Each new inventions that humanitiy makes becomes more and more complex so that even one single person cant undestand all of it. So it is important to specialize in one subject. On the other side a point for a broad knowledge is that all this specific knowledge has to be combined to become an efficient solution. By remaining in the scientific field of physics it can be mentioned that results that came up in atomic research have big influence to research on the whole universe. Thus there has to be a person who recognizes relationships between to diffrent areas of research. The problem occuring with this contradictionary ideas is that there has to be one part of people who have to specialize and another part that posses a broad knowledge to have an overview over all fields of researches.So by choosing the major subject at a university it is evident that the student knows in which position he wants to work in his or her later life. Will he or she go very far into detail of a subject or more have an overview about a subject.Thus at the end I have to conclude that there cant be a ""yes"" or ""no"" on the statement. It depends on what the person who has to decide likes better. Taking a job with caractaristics of leadership, then decide for broad knowledge. Choosing more scientific detailed work then it is better to have a specific knowledge.";1.7731098313451255;5.0

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high; People go somewhere every day in life. And they use trasportation vehicles in order to go to the place that they want. I think the most comfortable one is the cars. I do not agree with the statement that In twenty years thre will be fewer cars in use than there are today because of the following reasons. First reason is that travelling by cars is the most comfortable way in short distances. In Turkey most of the people prefer their cars instead of puplic transpotation. We can understand this from the number of cars in the traffic. Especially the time that the people exit from their jobs, there is a traffic jam in everywhere and this indicates that people prefer travelling by car. So they cannot give up travelling by cars. Secondly, there are fewer cars in the past but this number is increased much more today. This shows that in the future this number will continue to increase. Maybe in the future the railway system will developed and be common but this will not prevent the use of cars. Third reason is that peoples buying power increased according to the past and everyone can easily buy a car in Turkey. Furthermore, there is more than one car belong to a family. Since the railway system is not developed exactly and the fee of the tickets are not cheap to buy, it is cheaper to go to the short distances by car. Thus people prefers their cars. Finally, in the future cars will run with electricity or water or other cheap substances. Then therefore travelling by car will be the most preferable way of going to places in the following twenty years. To sum up, there will be more cars in use than there are in the future because of the reasons that I have mentioned above. ;1.6637741983216512;5.0

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;Poeple strive for success in many ways. Some people specialize in what they already know how to do well. Others, however, are brave enough to try new things and take risks. Given the fact that we are living in a rapidly changing society, I agree that successful people are the latter ones who continuoulsy change their paths of life.Firstly, trying new things and taking risks often leads people to see new opportunities. The technology and business are changing fast. If people stick to the old ways of thinking, they may be left behind by the society. So we should be open-minded to the new environment. For example, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, took great risks when he decided to quit from university and start his own business. That was indeed a very brave and insightful choice for an undergraduate student to make. Because Bill Gates seized the new opportunity without hesitation, he gained great success. Noy only can we have new opportunities by taking risks, there is also higher rate of return. When people only do what they already know how to do well, they have little room for improvement. Thus they cannot gain more for themselevs nor contribute more to the society. In contrary, high risks often implys high rate of return. Those who try new things often get more because of the risks undertaken. My Marketing professor, for example, changed his career several times from amanager to aconsultant to a professor. He really gains much life experience and at the same time makes good fortune.As stated above, trying new things and taking risks would bring people valuable opportunities and good return. We all live in a increasingly competitive society. That is why we should adapt to the changing world by changing ourselves. is exactly the way that leads to success.;1.612868644311332;4.0

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;I do not think that the number of cars will decline within the next twenty years for several reasons. There are big countries with growing populations which will have a huge demand for cars. Moreover, cars become even more affordable. The environmental problems which come along with the use of cars will be reduced, and alternative sources of energy will be found in order to satisfy the increasing demand. Thus, I do not agree with the thesis that fewer cars will be used in twenty years than there are today.Big countries such as China or India have a huge demand for cars as their respective economies are growing and their inhabitants are becoming wealthier. Thus they will be able to afford buying cars. As cars are still perceived as symbols of power which represent a certain way of life, many individuals will acquire cars in order to demonstrate their new status. In addition, cars might contribute to the development of the large rural territories of those countries.Moreover, cars will become even cheaper due to industrial and technological progress. Modern production plants provide much more efficacy than older ones did and require less ressources in order to produce cars. Thus, the average cost of cars will decline. Hence, it will be easier to sell cars even in underdeveloped regions.Finally, many of the environmental problems that come along with the use of cars will be solved. There are already devices which effectively reduce the emissions of cars. Alternative sources of energy such as electricity or sustainable fuels will be found. That is, future cars will not have to rely on gas and oil. A lot of research is being done in this regard and has already yielded some encouraging results.To sum it up, there is a growing demand for cars. On the other hand, cars are becoming cheaper, and the environmental problems caused by cars will be reduced. Hence, I think the number of cars will increase and not decline.;1.7716710379297154;5.0

But is this prediction relevant?Our modern world is going to face, in a few decades, many issues related to oil and the fact that our civilisation is nearly a hundred percent based on its consumption. Indeed, oil resources are not eternals and some consequences of its incomming lack are already being faced: prices are going up and important political decisions (such as going to war) are being taken. Moreover, virtually all scientists agree that the greenhouse effect is going to change our world if we dont do something. All those things might lead to the slow discrease of the number of cars. They pollute too much and might become too expensive .But, to me, saying that this change will occure within twenty years is false. Indeed, specialists estimate that the oil resources will still last for fifty years. Moreover, developping countries, like China or India, are becoming huge customers of the car industry. All this tend to say that the number of car will still grow for, at least, twenty years...But yet, some changes can be seen around the world: new types of cars are being created. Thus, I think that the car will never desc: it is just going to evolve to meet our needs! Cars will be running with new types of energies like hydrogen or solar energy. They might become smaller that the cars we know, include an autopilot mode, have a totally different shape or even fly. But still they will be cars! The concept of car will never disappear because people need their independance, they need to feel free to go where ever they feel like and on their own. This is to say that public transport wont ever outcome cars...So the car of the futur wont, probably, look like or even run like the ones we have now, it might be a plane, a car and a boat at the same time, but it will never disappear.All this makes me think that saying the number of cars will decrease in a twenty years time is irrealistic.;1.5361617322705727;4.0

First, people have jod are usually have the smalily then they were educaed subject in the college which they already perpared for the jod that they are going to do. However, people didnt change jod too much once they were get used to on they own jod, so that is why people make different types money and how suessful their will be.

However, when a person who specialized in one specific subject is able to make it a profession, a person who just knows little bits and pieces about many subjects is not able to. In my opinion, this depends on what kind of future you are looking at. If you are trying to be a professional on a specific field, majoring in one specific subject might be more favorable. If you are looking at an adventurous life, you should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects.If you are not in a hurry about the future occupation or profession, you are likely to be better off having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than just one. You will be able to connect to all kinds of different people since you are able to understand them. Interacting with many different kinds of interesting people is a fairly attractive idea. For example, you are likely to come across many situations during your life where you get to talk to people in general, not just people in your own fieldt. Talking and making friends with different kinds of people will make your life more adventurous.However, if you are in a hurry to get a job, you are better off majoring in one specific subject. You will have a more limited knowledge, but if you want to be a professional in a particular field, you do not really have to know things that are not related to your field. Yes, it might be a little boring, but at least you will get to have a fairly organized, stable life. There are many advantages and disadvantages about having broad knowledge of many academic fields and specializing in a particular subject. You cannot state which one is better and which one is worse. It all really depends on what kind of future you are looking at. If you want an adventurous, active life, you should have a broad knowledge of many fields. But if you are satisfied with a calm, stable life, majoring in one particular subject might be more suitable. ;1.3951679236155465;3.0
38209.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Young people enjoy life more than older people do.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;"It is generally believed that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Some people think, as young people are less aware of the seriousness of certain events, they can enjoy everything more than older people do. Other people oppose this point. As for me, I agree to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do.On the one hand, young people believe that older people can enjoy life more than they can. When I was a girl, I used to think that my parents and my grand parents are very lucky, because they didnt have homeworks, and could do whatever they want to do. I remember when I was 13 I said to my mom that I want to be 30 right now, because at this age, nothing were forbidden to me. I was so fed up to hear the adults saying ""You cannot do this, you are too young"" , or ""You cannot stay here, we are discussing about a subject that you cannot understand !!"" I was very upset, and thought that would be great to be older so that I can really enjoy life.However, I do not see it this way now. It seems to me that being young is synonym of being free, being independant. We can do whatever we want to without being always anxious.. Is that good? Am I suppose to do this? I really believe in the fact that, as young people are less aware of the seriousness of certain events, it is easier for them to enjoy life. Moreover, since we are still young, we have everything to discover. It is great and amazing to discover some new country for example when we have the opportunity to travel, to learn different cultures from all around the world. Furthermore, as we do not have children yet, we feel free to go out at night for parties, to do many things we wont be able to do in the future. Indeed, day after day, we would certainly feel bored to do always the same things, and we would not enjoy it likely.Last but not least, even if we have to study a lot, even if we have to work hard and may feel depressed time by time, I must recognise that it is even more interesting than staying at home everyday. It is more exciting to live without knowing what we will do tomorrow, than live everyday likely.On the whole, I admit that I agree with the statement, because I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do as it is the first time they had discovered everything.

395987.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;I disagree with the statement. Lets guess what can be the possible reason or factors which can lead to fewer cars in future.One reason may be that fossils fuels would be exhausted. Then there would be no way to run the cars, which may lead to decrease in their numbers. But scientists have estimated that there is enough fossil fuel for the next fifty years. So my guess is that cars number may go down but certainly not in the next twenty years.One may argue the due to unforeseen reason the cost of fuel goes up. Even if that is the case, I hold to my claim that the number of cars running on the roads will not decrease. Because cost of everthing is related to the cost of petroleum fuel, directly or indirectly. On the whole the relative cost of the fuel will remain the same. There would be no reason to abandon your cars. Yes, there is a possibility that new transport vehicle comes into the picture in the coming years. But it would be expensive. All products in testing phase are expensive. The new products cannot reach to mass production stage in just twenty years. How many years do you think inventions like aeroplane, television, even the electric bulb took to come to a situation where they were mass produces. You have to build the entire architecture for that new product, which may take more time than the development of the product. Like to operate a electric bulb you need a fully functional electric network!People are not going to dump their cars for a new product. This is especially true for the people in underdeveloped and developing people, where they dont throw away even non functional things! And these people constitute a majority when the whole world is considered. Also there is a reliability issue. The cars after serving decades are quite reliable. You have choices. There are motor cars. There are flashy royal cars like Mercedes. You have entire car sport based on them. People are not going to abondon them in such a short time. Though vehicles have replaced the use of animals like horses for transportation but there are still horse races. The number of horses has not come down. One may claim that people might become so serious about the pollution so they may stop using cars. They are not going to be serious unless it threatens their lives. And if the number of cars does not multiply beyond our imagination, there will not be a situation where car pollution would hurt us that much. The situation, I guess, will remain the pretty same.It is possible that the world comes to an end. Or the whole world would be submerged in water. Thats a different issue. Assuming that life goes on as it is now and no such abnormal activity happens, I see no reason why the number of cars being used will come down. ;1.7835573607380042;5.0

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;low;In my opinion the enjoymanet of young people are more than thats for older people, because young people dont have a lot of ressponsibilities during the youth period such as that upon older people which include home loans,taxes,bills....etc. Also youth always appear interested in parties and week end journies done by their friends, On other hand old people prefer stability, comfort and money savings.The youth always like traveling and changing its life routine which he assume a killing factor for his social relations that spent a lot of time producing them. while the older people prefer routine and reacts against changes of their life style what ever it was.According to the long experince of older people, their are more many things in life than enjoy, for example health, security which appears meanless for the youth. Those they have attendance to keep in track for much more time to benefit from each second of the life.Finally, according to the prementioned factors, older people have less enjoy than young people, and thats clear from the saying (eat to live or live to eat) which best illustrate the difference between this two kind of human beings. ;1.2857983682983682;2.0
412197.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Young people enjoy life more than older people do.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;" ""Seize the day"" used to say the Epicurists, who else but young people would apply this moral point of view? Indeed I think that young people do better know how to enjoy life than older people. There are several reasons for this belief. First of all I must acknowledege than the older people do, in one way, enjoy life for the simple reaon that their life is coming to its end. But, given that, I think that the young people live their life more intensively than their fathers or grand fathers do. Why do I say that? Because teenagers, and the young adults are eager to live their life, not only to live it in a normal way but to feel they are alive. They want to feel the life flowding in their veins. Thus they do crazy things thinking that they may be unable to do it afterwards. For instance young people are very fast drivers, very heavy drinkers, and very good at partying all night long. Moereover, they dont only live more intensevely ""normal life"" but they are also looking for crazy things to do like jumping from an aircraft or jumping with an elastic from very high spots. I dont think that an eighty-years-old-grand mother would do that. Thus for two reasons. One is that she will be physically too old, an other one is that she will be mentally too old. At her age pleasures of life does not remain in risky things to do. She is just looking for some quiet stuff to make. But is she still enjoying life? She is certainly enjoying the end of it when young people are enjoying the dawn of it. That is the other main reason why young people are not only enjoying life but living it. Its because all opportunities are wide opened to them. A young mind is full of projects whereas an old one is full of memories. One is living things for real, an other is living them in fiction. All in all it appears that the young seize the day when the older look at it. But we cant deny them any pleasure for that. They are just saying ""carpe diem"" in a more peaceful way.";1.5206969200733904;4.0

They regard life as a more colorfull way than the older do. Take school teachers for example, a large quantities of them says they love thier vocation as teaching. A main reason for this is that they are exposed to young people, whose thoughts are fresh and lives are lively. Teachers are obsessed by the joyness of young people.By living with them, teachers are sometimes find themselves back in thier young pirod. Besides, when off campus, young people have more purchasing ability than older people ,so the amount of money they spend in varied typed of recreation are larger than order people spend. For young people , they are more likely to obtain the happiness through buying new clothes, shoes, movies as well as eating out in fine restaurant with friends. With the supplying of money, they can realise enjoy their life in such ways. Whats more ,the internet seems more attractive to young people than the older. Young people enjoy sufing in the internet including chating with thier friends and even by web-camara. In this way they enjoy life more than older people do.Last but not the least, the society gives more oppurtunities to enjoy their lives to young people. For example, young people often go to sing songs in such places that older people seldom go.

But personally I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Here are the reasons and examples from my experiences to support my opinion.First, I am thinkig about my mathematics class in high school. I learned many facts how to solve the problems.My teacher just taught the method to solve the problem. We didnt focus much on the theory, which is origin of the solving method.I was good at solving problems on exams, but now I forgot most of problem solving methods. I cannot apply to real life. I believe it is caused by learning just facts, not the whole ideas or concepts.Second, I want to talk about my design class at college.Professor taught about wide variety of the ideas and concepts of the art history. And she gave the specific facts of each ideas and concepts. It is much easier to approach the class because we understand the ideas and concepts first, it helped a lot to understand each characteristics and facts. It also helped when I developed my design and portfolio. If I just learn how to make the portfolio with same way or how to sew my design just following the direction, How can it be different from others? In conclusion, We should understand the ideas and concepts first. This is the way we can reapply the ideas and concepts to real life. If we just learn the facts, we cannot be creative and reapply the ideas and concepts to the real life. I truly believe the statement that understand ideas and concepts is more important to students than learning facts.;1.726397768897769;5.0

594970.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;In general I agree with this statement. The task of education is to learn general skills, concepts and cultural abilities that can be useful in different situations. If the students are fed up only with facts and particular informations they are not likely to develop the ability to collect, use and elaborate these informations. We may use two kinds of examples to shed a light on this question. Firstly, let us use this comparison. If the mind is like a computer, we can say that the concepts are like the software and that the facts are like the informations processed by the software. Without the software the brute informations have no meaning and are useless, but, nevertheless, without the informations the software is empty. Then, concepts and facts are necessary to each other. Secondly, we may analyse the case of history. There is a great historiographical debate between those who conceive the history as made of singular facts and those who see the history as made of great movements. But leaving aside this problem, we can say that the general historical concepts, such as modernization, industrial revolution, etc., help the historian in the collection and interpretation of the facts. Without a general idea that gives the direction, the historian would not be able to make his research and give a meaning to the facts he collects. Furthermore, general historical concepts are very useful for the students. Without learning basic historical movements and periods, a student cannot remember so many historical facts. Concepts help the memory and the understanding of things. As a general conclusion, we may say that, if the facts give the specifical informations on a topic, the concepts provide the general understanding. Probably, the concepts stem from an operation of synthesis of different facts under a unique point of view, but when a concept is understood, it can be used as a tool in different situations. Finally, it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts, because the task of education is the development of general skills. If this is not learned the student will not be able to work on the facts and will be like an database full of information and unable to use them.;1.636449798079679;4.0

Todays young generation is the ""busy generation"", the generation which does not think 24 hours in a day is sufficient. But the truth is not that there is a shortage of time but that there is absolutely lack of time management. People just dont plan their time which leads to a disorganised schedule and the end result is that they dont get their priorities right. As a result they tend to focus more on meeting ""their"" needs and are not bothered about giving something back to the community we come from. The phrase ""community service"" is rarely heard these days. Well, who then is to blame for such a sorry state? All of us. Community service starts at home. Helping the elderly at home or planting trees in the neighbourhood also constitutes community service.The schools, the children study in, the colleges teens go to, the offices people work in are all equally responsible. It is in these places that the seeds of community service should first be planted. The consiousness to help the society we come from should gradually dawn in. Commuity service can take many forms. For example, the school children could be made to collect old clothes and food items and donate it to an orphange. A company could take the initiative in mantaining a park or a colony clean. Students in colleges should start groups or join an existing group and teach the underprivileged children in the adjacent localities. Funds could be raised by way of organising cultural programmes or entertainment shows and the money collected be distributed to charities. And if there is any time when community service matter most, it is in times of severe strife, esp natural disaster such a floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, etc. After all what happens to a person today may happen to us tomorrow.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;"I believe with the statement that ""Young peoples nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities"". Primary reasons for such attitude would be drastic change in their lifestyle, constant peer pressure, too much focus on shaping their own carrers and change in social values. I would take some of these issues to prove my stand. Young people are now under the effects of corporate culture everywhere. Whether this be their schoo, home or office . This demands them to be at their best everytime. They are expected to be first in their classes, decide startegies of business management, earn money. All these leads them to focus more on shaping their own identity and rather contributing towards their community. Young people put in much more efforts in terms of physical work then being put up by people of same age generations ago. This leaves them absolutely with no time for contributing towards their community. With such mad rush behind money, young people have become highly self-centric. They are not worried about suffering of their community, let alone doing something to remedify it. Young people with their living habits, social settings and behavior patterns likes to remain detached from everyone else. Leaving community, young people find it difficult to communicate with their parents and family members. This is not just because of communication gap but as well they are not concerned about their state. In most of the cases they are non existent for them. With such apathetic attitude towards their parents, spending time for their community can be easily ruled out. Idea to help and connect is dying. A perfect example of this could be of how we like to make new friend through internet but young people are hardly aware of sufferings of r next door neighbour. Perhaps an example of apathy of young people towards their community can be best seen with recent Katrina hurricance in America. There were hardly any initiative being taken by any young people. Hence people do not give time to helping their communities. ";1.713735419170202;5.0

656695.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;The very task and eventually also the goal of advertisements is it, to promote a specific product in a way that makes it difficult for the potential customer to withstand from purchasing it. Therefore, those responsible to create commercials and advertisements, might be tempted to make certain products look better than they actuallly, soleley in order to gain a higher profit. This, I believe, is also the intrinsic factor in my essay, it is the greed of a capitalistically driven world to gain more and this more can be labelled as money.So, how is it possible to gain this precious metal?Many adds focus on the fears people have, and the fears in western societies are very often linked to the fact of growing older. This is escpecially true for the use or one might even be able to call it abuse of women growing older, who in our socities are still greatly judged according to their outer appearance. Simultaneously with their outer beauty fading away and the first wrinkles appearing their pockets are becoming looser and they are ready to respond to corresponding adds. The adds usually show women who lose their wrinkles thanks to a great new cosmetic invention within only a couple of weeks. In fact, it is true, according to scientific research, that events like this dont occur overnight, not even within a two-week-period. To me, this sounds very much like withholding information from the public and making use of the existing lack of knowledge on this subject.Another example shows this even more thoroughly.Many adds praise the outstanding advantages of eating a special yoghurt full of specific micro-organisms, which contribute to the well functioning of our intestines. Yet, what everybody who as a little understanding of the biology of human beings as well as the entire biosphere, knows, is that every single yoghurt, not just this very specific one, contains exactly the same fabulous micro-organisms, surprise, surprise! This definitely can only be referred to as misleading information.In the light of what I have tried to elaborate on, it appears to be very obvious that I very much agree with the question being posed here. Advertisements which should in fact inform public properly on the products they promote, do very often pass on misleading information. ;1.3226363879960854;3.0

67346.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Young people enjoy life more than older people do.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;For my part, I do not think that young people enjoy their life more than adults. I have in mind further reasons to explain that children or young people also have some problems. Fisrtly, I think this kind of statement is obviously done by an adult. Why? Because adults or old people have, must of the time, a certain nostalgy of their young years. I mean they tend to have better souvenirs than what really happenned in their life. The truth is not in the memories.Secondly, adults often forget that young people have problems, and sometimes it is not minor problems. They can meet some difficulties at school. If children are not good students they might meet some difficulties to have friends or good relationship with their professors or even with their parents. Even worse, young people are used to face the violence. Parents and adults often bear in mind what was the school 20 years ago, that is to say safe and quiet. It is not the case todayany more. Children face racist and rude words from other students.Thirdly, and it may be the main point, we need to wonder why when you are young you always want to be an adult. I remenber when I was ten or eleven, I wanted to be older to be allowed to watch TV in the evening or to be able to do everything I want to. We have to bear in mind the childhood and the pre-adult steps are really very hard. Young people must build their own identity, but in the same time they are under influence. According to official figures, suicide is one the main death causes after car accidents. It shows how it is difficult to be young.As a conclusion, it is obvious that yound people heve more leisure times and holidays than adults. But they also meet situation and problem to sort out. To be honest I think people are able to enjoy their like along their all life they just have to do the right choice, be happy or sad.;1.5240494208615412;4.0
711394.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;The use of cars has increased rapidly over the last few years. Almost everybody uses his car daily for example to go to work.The question whether in twenty years less cars will be used than nowadays is fairly hard to answer.On the one hand I think this statement will become true for several reasons.First of all gas prices are rising constantly for the last few years and this trend seems to continue. Therefore many people will not be able to keep their cars or at least reduce the distances they dirve to a minimum. Instead they will try to find alternatives such as taking the train or the bus.Furthermore the reached level of pollution caused by cars is already very high nowadays. The governments will probably try to find solutions for this problem, which could be either higher taxes or to forbid driving to some kind of cars or even completely on some days in the year. If the first thing happens, having a car will again be more expensive and like this a lot of people will not be able to keep their cars. On the other hand there are also reasons that support the idea that in the future the number of cars will not decline.Allthough there will be more alternatives in the future to travel comfortably, made possible by for example new inventions like the transrapid, these inventions are still to expensive for most of the people. Therefore it will still be cheaper to go by car. The effect of the ricing prices in the energy sector on public transport media has to be considered as well. Prices for using a bus or a train might become higher and the car could eventually still be the cheapest way to travel.Apart from that many people reject going by train or bus because they want to maintain their independancy. If you go by car you have no fixed times for leaving. You can just stay as long as you wish and do not have to care about the timeMoreover there are not direct connections available for all places to go. You might have to spend some extra time to reach your goal through changing the train or having to take routes for which you need more time.Taking all this into consideration I think that there will not be fewer cars in the future, because most people prefer going by car instead of using other transportation media.;1.679143262195894;5.0
71654.txt;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high; I dont believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. There are few reasons for this. Firstly,in todays world transport is the main important and essential thing. People are used to go in their own vehicles to different places. They are accustomed to the use of their own vehicles. Very few people use public transport. Almost every person owns a car. They find this convinient. Second,if a person uses his own car,he will probably reach the destination in less time. Thus this is time saving and every person wants to save time. For example, a business person who is always busy in meetings has to attend another important meeting in just few minutes at some other place,he finds his car more convinient than any other means of transport. He just reaches the destination in time or probably earlier. Such is the imporatance of car to a person. So it is not possible for such persons to stop using it. Third,the person is free to use the car at any time he wants because he owns it. Thus this gives them more convinience.For ex,a person wants to attend a party in the afternoon ,he can reach the place within few minutes if he uses his own car. But if he relies on some other means of transport(probably public transport which will not be available at our convinient times),he would probably reach the place after the party is actually over. Fourth,since the technology is fast growing ,today there are a wide variety of cars available. Since there is a competetive market, the cars are sold at lower prices. Its not a problem for a person to buy it. Fifth,there are places which are accessible or which makes them easier to reach only if they go in their own vehicle. using a car also prevents the person from being exposed to hot sun,cold weather and rain. Thus a person would find this more convinient and cant restrict himself from using his own car. Thus i conclude that because of all the above mentioned reasons such convinience,reduced cost,etc the usage of cars will not be reduced. ;1.5879569329019794;4.0

Only if a product is advertised as the best there is on the market, customers are going to buy it. At least, that is what advertising companies suggest us to believe. But usually the products ad in newspapers or on TV look much better than the product actually is. The ""real"" product sometimes does not have the features of its media counterpart.Fast food , for example, uses great advertising strategies. And if you see an advertised hamburger in the media, they really look delicate. A lot of lettuce squeezes out between the meat and the bread. However, if the customers then test the actual performance of the fast food restaurant, they will be disppointed. In comparison to the gleaming burger in the ad, a ""real"" burger that is made in a short time without much care does not fulfill the standard shown in the advertisement.The advertisements of cleaning materials also show features these materials are lacking. On homeshopping channels customers can watch experiments in which a cleaning liquid is first used in the car, then in the dirty bathroom and then for the windows. The customers are made to believe that one cleaner can be used for everything, and so they might save money when they only buy this universal cleaner, since they do not need other materials any longer.These ads are cleverly produced in a TV studio, but customers should think that it is a live-performance they are watching. The advertisments producers manipulate the customers, who do not understand the real purpose of the TV performance of the cleaner.As a conclusion it can be stated that advertisements show features of products that do not exist. Unfortunately, there are too many customers that are easy to manipulate, since they do not consider advertisements correctly. ";1.610064758993005;4.0

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;"STUDENTS SHOULD RELY IN FACTS AND NOT CONCEPTSAfter I graduated from high school, my physics teacher taught me all kind of concepts for algorythms and formulas. Later, at the university, when i was doing my internship, I look back and asked myself. Why I did not learned more didactic and practical things? Facts are the best teacher that a person could have in his life. Concepts are good for the basic teaching but it is not useful in the real life. Actions demostrate ten times more than a single concept. A good idea is the one that it is made a reality. For example, lets imagine that I am an engineer and I only know the concept to operate a machine. Can you imagine? What am I going to do when I will be in front of my boss and tell him, ""I only know the concepts."" It is ridiculous, to learn something without a logical meaning. Facts are the physical prove of a hypothesis or a project. a student can not learn just an idea, they need to know how to develop the concept. In particular When I was working in a manufacturing industry, we had to give our client his product. We could not just tell him that we had the idea of what to do but not how to do it. Thus, it is important to be awarness of what a student is learning becuase if he does not, it is only an a waste of time.A student has to consider the facts instead of the ideas becuase it is the only way for the student to understand the purpose of a lesson. In particular, I enjoy taking classes at SECAP because they give a few theorical classes and the rest is useful practice which will help me in my career.It is clear, then that the ideas are just a vague imaginary actions that should be put into action. Hence, students and myself have to rely on the facts of every lesson, for those are the ones that really matter in our life and society. Between an idea and action, there is a process to work on.

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;Many of us are eager to become successful people. However, many successful people did not magically succeed one day. They all took a risk of being a failure or overcame the struggles. Therefore, I agree that successful people try new things and take risks. For example, Bill Gates, one of the most successful businessmen in the world, did not even graduate from the university. His great invention, Windows was nothing but a program with simple design at that time. His courage and plan, however, was not simple nor easy at all. As if he needed to prove that he is a talented businessman, he had to visit numerous numbers of people to pursuade them that his invention is amusing. Additionally, Bill Gates did not always succeed. His business went through several hard times. His business went through several trials because people were jealous of him all the time. Once, he had to leave the company for dominating the market. This is very absurd in my opinion because if running the business really well is a problematic, how come many people are trying so hard to become a successful business man? Gates another great invention, XBOX, shows another example. At that time, the future of XBOX was very unclear. The market was already being dominated by SONYs Playstation II. Plus, if XBOX had failed to success in the market, that would have been another life time crisis for BIll Gates. Bill Gates took the risk of selling ungaurenteed product to the market and thanks to his idea, XBOX almost dominated the market in the North America. Now, consumers can enjoy different kinds of machines.To conclude, successful people cannot success without taking a risk of being a failure. However, it is not the luck or fortune that makes the sucessful person. It is the courage and careful plan that creates one succesful person. Hardly anyone seems to realize this and often blame God for not having enough luck! ;1.7470972116973607;5.0

It does not matter in which part of the world we live, we can be aware of all the happenings in other parts as well. Moreover, Media has contributed a lot in the world of advertisement. Before launching of any product, the company promotes its product with the help of media. We know the name of a particular product and its significant feature before it is launced in the market. And as a result the demand of the product increases. Media plays a major role in successful launching of any product. The world of bussiness is based on two very important words:""demand"" and ""supply"". Knowing about the product and its significant feature even before its market supply, greatly increase its demand. But advertisement only add profits to its manufacturers and mislead its customers.These advertisement introduce these products in a colourful fashion. We can see most actors and actresses in the advertisement of Soaps, cars and many cosmetic items. These advertisements lure public and portray that this perticular item is the best as this film star or sport star is using the same.The manufacturers show only those features that they want to show. They never highlight all the features of the product so that the customers can have real idea of the product. Due to the presence of many similar items, customers may have many choices but it is actually very confusing because they only have a vague idea of everyone. So, these advertisement mislead public.Thousand and thousand of dollars are spend on these advertisement to make it more charming and colourful. But the cost of these advertisement is added on the cost price of the product. So, finally the customer has to bare the cost of these advertisement. Lets take an example every month a new toothpaste is introduced by the same company by just adding some more fancyful features and attract public through advertisement.

Posters, television, radio, newspapers, and even the internet - all the mass media - are concerned, as most of them rely on advertisement to survive. There are so many ocasions to come across advertisements that it is even easy to let oneself be convinced and seduced by one of them. Hasnt it happened to all of us? But what about the products themselves? Have you never ever been disappointed or felt betrayed by advertisements?Over the last decade, advertisements professionals have developed an increasing number of sophisticated communication strategies to make the consumers buy their products. Advertisements make us laugh,they make us cry, and brands mark our mind and influence our judgment. Were we to listen to advertisers, all products would be of the best quality. It is true that consumers can sometimes be tricked into believing that a product is better than it really is, but the advertisement executives cannot really be blamed for it. Consumers play the game.Brands are signals to them, which they use to shop quicker and to which they are often faithful by principle. Consumers altogether also form a consumer society. These consumer society spread information and often condemn misleading advertisements and products, which quality is not what they expected. In short, consumers are an active alive community, which members communicate with each other.

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;I agree that that it is more difficult to assimilate an idea unless there is a good example to support it. In order to make them reachable, ideas and concepts should be followed by real facts taken from everydays life experiences. To illustrate with an example, a concept such as freedom has a very broad meaning and therefore it may be difficult to categorize and confine it with a few sentences. It should be presented with examples from different places around the world, related to people with completely different cultural backgrounds. Important facts that changed the course of the history should be given. The first major movement that started in the name of freedom is the French Revolution. It changed the face of the world in a very positive way. This would be an excellent example to explain the fact that freedom is essential for anyone who wants to live his/her life proudly and respectfully. Everyone has a right to make his/her own decision and respect other peoples decisions. Also, one should have the freedom to express him/herself. There should be a tolerance and respect toward different opinions. Scientists, writers who are killed violently because of their opinion should be given as examples to illustrate the danger when one overtakes anothers freedom of expression. With freedom comes another concept which is equality. This idea can also be supported by many historical events that took place and still take place. People with different races, religion and culture should be treated equally. There should be no judgements on peoples opinions based purely on which religion or culture they belong to. Unfortunately, even today, we see many examples of inequality. Every day newspapers are full of them, and I think a professor will have no difficulty to show students a few facts illustrating the examples of inequality. ;1.6448323113170895;5.0

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;I disagree with the prior statement for several reasons. When we say that is is better to do this or that, we should ask ourselves: better for whom? Is it better for me, for the others, for society as a whole? I think that altough a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be fruitful for individuals, societies rely more and more on specialized knowledge. And this is why i disagree with the statement. The first argument is that if a society values knowledge, and ours does, then it should realize that the pursuit of knowledge is fostered by intense research in areas that become by necessity the object of further and further specialization. To increase our knowledge about things, be it nature, or the social realm, or just abstract math, we need researchers to constantly go beyond what they already know. It is only by being at the forefront of a given discipline that we can gain more knowledge about it. The second argument in support of specialized knowledge is that we, as a society - even though there are relevant exceptions-, do not pursue knowledge only for knowledges sake. We use knowledge in order to satisfy an objective, be it the improvement of our societies, or of our health, or whatever it is we want to improve. Doctors want to heal people, engineers want to build bridges. Most of our societys needs depend on specialized knowledge. Broad knowledge of many subjects can serve the spirit, but the well-being of modern societies requires more than well-educated, well-rounded citizens.Last but not least, our societies, which we value, as we have already said, need to be sustainable in the long term. Sustainability -economic, social, ecological- is a complex issue and we as a society need to educate people that should be able to treat this complex phenomena.These are some of the reasons why we can say that specialized knowledge is better for our societies and therefore that is is better to have this kind of knowledge than having broad knowledge of many subjects. That said, individuals should be interested in areas in which they are not specialized, because thirst of knowledge is part of being human and it makes our societies richer in variety and more interesting.;1.522470956191174;4.0

In my personal experience, I am a general dental practitioner, or a normal dentist. I know how to do my work in order to obtain good results. I would never try something new or risky in order to be more brave if I do not know for sure it will end successfully.Those who take risks to ""try"" to find success is because they have nothing to loose. For instance, imagine I had a business and for any reason it just failed. I would loose all my investment and I would be in bankrupcy. I have lost eveything. In this case if someone told me that he/she had an exeptional opportunity for me to start a business from the very beginning I would take the risk becuase I have nothing to loose.Lets see another example in my professional life. A patient comes into my surgery complaining of pain in the central incisor. I take an x-ray and has a very big infection in the root. I have never done an apiceptomy (open the gum and cut the root) and I would never try to do one without the appropiate training as it can be dangerous for the patient. I would never take this risk to be successful in this case.In sum, I completely disagree with the statement as I believe success is something you can find in your day by day life without taking any risk.

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	;high;I dont think that in twenty years ther will be fewer cars than now because sales of cars are increasing day by day. More people are using cars as it is easy to own a car today and many low cost cars are coming into the depending on demand of people ans usage.Twenty years from now there will be more and more people coming to cities and towns in search of jobs and other requirements and population is increasing day by day. So after few years many people would require cars for their personal use. Now the number of cars are less becuase becuase big car companies donot go into remote places and villages to sell the cars as many people dont buy them. In future they might go into remote places in order to increase their sales. This is not possible today for many car companies because they dont have many funds to do provide cars and market them in villages.Now a days there is only one car per family because only one person works in a family in India. In the future both wife and husband may work and both require cars. Needs of people are growing, people who own a two wheeler today want to shift to a car tomorrow.Population is increains so to meet the increasing demand of the people more cars are manufactured so that every person can own a car and not depend on others. Car companies are increasing their production day by day in order to get more profits and the company will prosper. They are increasing their production seeing the increaing demand in the market. Demand is increasing in the market as better roads are laid, better infrastructure is devloped and policies are made such that cost of the car comes down and even common man can own a car. These all reasons suggest that more and more cars will be used by people in the future.Many banks and financial companies are bringing out plans so that it is easy for a person to earn a car. This plan will increase the number of cars on road as it is no longer a burden to own a car.Due to advancement in technology new cars are coming with more latest features which makes a persons desire to eard a car. Growth in technology and ways of manufacturing cars are bringing out many cars which are advancement to their previous models. Through all this means it will increase the number of cars in the near future.Before car was used as just a transportation mediun. Now it is not like that as owning a car is a passion and even desire to some people. There were only few features in cars before but now a days the features in cars are multiple, with this you along with driving can do other work like listening to music relaxing and even office paper work as cars donot shake or give disturbace while driving.Improvement in technology is making car driving easy and ride more and more comfortable.So with all these reasons I dont think that number of cars after twenty years will come down but they will increase in number and increase in varities satisfying wide range of people using it. ;1.5157709433769004;4.0
